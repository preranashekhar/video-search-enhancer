  "transcript": "hey guys how's it going Laura with Garden answer today I want to share with you five of my favorite houseplants for low light areas in your house or office building huge thank you to his phone off or partnering with us on this video so let's just get right into the first one is a peace lily and I love this planet because not many plants that tolerate low light areas will Bloom but this one does it comes up with these really unique shaped blooms that range from like a green to a white and they bloom for a really really long time so this one will be up here for weeks before it starts to shrivel it needs to be cut back I also really like this shape of the foliage in the color is very dark green glossy it has a ton of worms do any area that you put him in that usually grow about 18 to 36 in tall and wide and they kind of steak size relative to the size of container you're keeping a man so if you keep them in a small container just a little bit more on a smaller size but if you keep bumping him up and pot size they will grow a little bit bigger so peacefully is do like to be consistently watered so you want to make sure to keep them on like a weekly waterschedule that's what I do with mine but they will tell you when they want a drink so they will will it down slightly you give him some water and they bounce back really fast house plant number two is a pothos which looks an awful lot like a philodendron which is also a really good low light plant they like an area that's out of direct sun and they're super low maintenance so you can train these onto a trellis or you can let them grow as a hanging plant I like to put mine up kind of bond wedges up above cabinets and let him kind of Trail down really really pretty I water mine about every 10 to 14 days so these are a little bit lower on the water requirement and then I just turned back anything that gets leggy to keep them nice and the third one is a sansevieria which you might also know as a mother-in-law tongue or a snake plant I just love the strong vertical intercept these bring to any area they look very modern to me and they come in lots of different colors and kind of shapes summer around the leaves around their kind of spiky looking summer heavily variegated like this one this one's got yellow margins and then it's got dark and light green in the leaves and some of the backsideplease even have the silverish color so I think that they're just super interesting and they're very low maintenance in terms of watering I probably Water Mine every two weeks and they say very happy the fourth one is a spider plant and these are super easy to fight and you might recognize this one right away maybe your grandma or your mom has one of these but they're very easy to propagate and pass on down the generations are they get their name because of all the runners that they send out the kind of spider out and then they've got little babies on the end and you can easily pop the babies off put them down in a pot full of fresh soil Waterman and in no time you'll have a rooted plant that's ready to go they come in a really nice dark green like this one this one's looking super healthy and they also come variegated and either white or yellow but they are probably a once-a-week on the watering schedule and they do really well in a little white spot the last house plant and probably my favorite out of the whole bunch is the ZZ plant I just like the way this one looks the best I love the way that grows and grows in a very strong base shape and they're alwaysfull of leaves and the leaves are always healthy looking it doesn't seem to suffer from tip for and like some of the other thing to do but they are dark green and glossy when they first emerged the leaves are really bright green and they kind of give you this really beautiful pop of color and they deepen and Colour this one is probably the most stuff of all the plants I showed you today they thrive on probably the lowest light and sporadic watering so if you are a traveler and you're not home very much as a really good option for you these also do really well under fluorescent lighting so if you're in an awful situation fees also will grow really well ZZ plants are really slow Growers so they don't need to be divided or repotted very often which makes him even more low maintenance but you can expect him to grow about 16 to 28 in tall and wide so those are for your office now I want to give you five tips and these are just a general tips for keeping your plants looking really good first of all low-light plants typically prefer dryer soil conditions other than the peace lily that I showed youI'm beginning that one likes more consistent waster but you want to make sure that the others are allowed to dry out before you water them again his number two is to about once a month use a damp cloth to wipe the leaves off of your plant it's really good idea to keep on a schedule to keep them clean it keeps the plants healthier and keeps them looking a lot better his number three is on how to combat tip burn in your plants can really detract from the look of them there's usually two culprits to tip for in the first is lack of humidity in the air especially in the dryer month so to combat that all you need to do is grab a spray bottle spray the area around your plant and that will really help the other thing is to water with either distilled water rain barrel water or water that's gone through Reverse Osmosis System rather than tap tap water usually has a little bit too many minerals and salts which can eventually accumulate in the leaves and cosburn the fourth step is to feed your plants on occasion with a houseplant specific fertilizer this is a good all-purpose indoor house plant food and I like to feed mine every about one to two months and the last tip tip number five is to make sure to check your plants Roots about every6 to 12 month so once or twice a year pop your plant out of its container take a look at the root system if it looks like it's getting root bound or it needs more room to grow make sure to repot in a pot one size larger with a really good potting mix so that's it you guys that was my five planets in my 5 tips hope this video was helpful and we'll see you in the next video by",
